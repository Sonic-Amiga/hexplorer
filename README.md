This project is an attempt to add a feature or two to a hexadecimal editor for Windows.

This reporitory uses a source release from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/hexplorer/files/hexplorer/hexplorer%202.17/hex_src_217b.zip/download; therefore it can be considered a fork. I will eventually connect with the original author and ask whether he is interested.

The original information in "About program" says:

Hexplorer v.2.17b (C) 2002-2003
